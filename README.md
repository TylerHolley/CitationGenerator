This program uses java to take in user inputs about the source they want to create a citation for. It then formats it all correctly and copies it to the clipboard so that the user can paste it easily into their choice of document.

TO DO:
  1. Add option(s) to skip fields if the information cannot be found or provided
  2. Expand on MLA source types
  3. Add APA and Chicago formats
